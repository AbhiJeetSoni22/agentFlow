react Agent per tool add ka solution

1. create api that will fetch all the agentflow whose flow type is " reactAgent " and return it
2. use that api in the NodeEditorSlideBar.jsx file in the getReactFlow function.
3. set these flow as function in the getFilteredFunction and then show them as option in the add tool fields
